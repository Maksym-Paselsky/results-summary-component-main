## Overview

My second challenge on FrontEnd Mentor. Simple project to get used to with css.

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size

## My process

I create html structure and then I use css-grid for main two sections, stylized them and finish with mobile version via media query.

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid

### What I learned

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```

Didn't know about aspect ratio before üßê

```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  width: 55%;
  max-width: 200px;
  aspect-ratio: 1/1;
  border-radius: 50%;
}
```

### Continued development

I want to dig into css-grid more and figure out proper usage of rem/em's to enable more smooth responsivness. CSS-grid and positioning is priority!üìù
